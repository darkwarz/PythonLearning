a = 1 # first value int 1 
print(a)
a = "I am back to learning to code again" # string
print(a)
a = 30   # changes value of a to int 30
print(a)

a = type(.5) # displays the type of number  float
print(a)
a= type(5)   # displays the type of number  int
print(a)   # prints variable

#a = 7.5 % 5 = 2.5  modulo remainder is 2.5 


# health = 50
#import random
#potion_health = random.randint(25,50)       25 is minimum range and 50 is max. and it will produce a random number
